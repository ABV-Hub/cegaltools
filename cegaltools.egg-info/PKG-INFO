        <h1>Cegal well log tool</h1>
        
        
        
        Cegal well tool package written by Hilde Tveit Haland and Thomas Grant, Cegal ASA, May 2020.
        
        Based on open source tools such as plotly, pandas and lasio, the package allows for loading and visualising of well logs from las files.
        
        Several built in plotting methods provides an easy to use out of the box tool for handling well logs using python.
            
        * self.report plots;
            * histogram of well index increments
            * log track of null value heatmaps for all loaded logs
            * histograms of log values for all loaded logs
            
        * self.plot_correlation;
            * plots a correlation plot of all available logs
            
        * self.plot_logs;
            * Log viewer which accepts three types og well logs;
                1) normal log tracks (parameter logs, string or list of strings)
                2) lithology logs as heatmaps (parameter lithology_logs, string or list of strings) 
                3) lithology probability logs as heatmaps (parameter lithology_proba_logs, string or list of strings)
        
        Planned extensions are simple editing tools for logs, including smoothing, splining and resampling.
