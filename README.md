> The Cegal Tools package aims to minimize time and effort for a geoscientist wanting to work with well logs using python.


> Based on open source tools such as plotly, pandas and lasio, Cegal Tools allow for simple loading, manipulation and visualising of well logs from las files.

    
> Several built in plotting methods provides an easy to use, out of the box well log tool for geoscientists using or wanting to learn python.

    from cegaltools.plotting import CegalWellPlotter as cwp
    
    cwp.plot_logs(df=dataframe, 
              logs=['gammaray','density', 'porosity'], 
              log_scale_logs='resistivity',
              lithology_logs='lithology', 
              lithology_proba_logs='lithology_probability')
